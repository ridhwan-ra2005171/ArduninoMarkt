## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or a compatible package manager
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account to set up the database and authentication.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ridhwan-ra2005171/ArduninoMarkt.git
    cd ArduninoMarkt
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase project URL and Anon Key. You can find these in your Supabase project's API settings.

    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Set up the Supabase database:**
    You will need to create the following tables in your Supabase project to match the application's data structure:
    *   `products`: For Arduino kits.
    *   `components`: For individual electronic parts.
    *   `projects`: For project tutorials and ideas.

### Available Scripts

*   **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

*   **Build for production:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

*   **Lint the codebase:**
    ```sh
    npm run lint
    ```
    This runs ESLint to find and fix problems in your code.
